# Chest Cancerous Cells Multi-Classification with CNN, ResNet, and Vision Transformers

This repository contains the code and resources for a comparative study of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Residual Networks (ResNet), and Vision Transformers for multi-classification of chest cancerous cells in X-ray images.

## Overview

Early and accurate detection of diseases is crucial for improving patient outcomes. This project focuses on utilizing deep learning techniques to classify chest X-ray images into different classes of cancerous cells. We compare the performance of CNNs, ResNet, and Vision Transformers to identify the most effective architecture for this task.

## Dataset

We use the NIH Chest X-ray dataset, which comprises 112,120 X-ray images with disease labels from 30,805 unique patients. The dataset is publicly available and includes labels relevant to cancer diagnosis.

## Installation

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CSC413-Final-Project.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the dataset from [NIH Chest X-ray dataset](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare-api/docs/resources/public-datasets/nih-chest) and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

Navigate to the directory containing the code and run the main script:

```
python main.py
```
